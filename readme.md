Beehive Forum


DESCRIPTION
===========

Beehive Forum is an online discussion forum with lots of cool features.

This is a fork of the [official Beehive repository](https://github.com/BeehiveForum/BeehiveForum)
so that I can experiment with various changes without getting in the way.

Note: The official readme is at docs/readme.txt



CHANGES
=======

Beehive is already awesome, but there are a number of changes that would make 
it even better.

Primarily, REST support - being able to access and interact with the forum via 
a REST API - will open up a whole variety of possibilities for further 
improvement and integration with other software.

However, there are a number of other assorted tweaks and improvements that may 
be made alongside this.

Development will be done following the [nvie git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
with each feature branch being related to an issue in [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/boughtonp/BeehiveForum/issues).
